## About Me
I primarily use Bitbucket for my projects, so what you'll find on my Github profile are simple demos, tutorials, and other practice projects I've completed over the years that I've gradually moved over from Bitbucket.  My more extensive projects are kept at Bitbucket in private repos.  If youâ€™d like to check out some of my other projects, please get in touch.
